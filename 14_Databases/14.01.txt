Multiple Apartments:

Write a SQL query to get a list of tenants who are renting more than one apartment.

Just retrieving Tenant ID:

SELECT TenantID, COUNT(ApartmentID) as NumApartments
FROM TenantApartments
GROUP BY TenantID
HAVING NumApartments > 1;

----

If we want the tenants' names we will need to join with the Tenants table:

SELECT FIRST(TenantName), COUNT(ApartmentID) as NumApartments
FROM TenantApartments
INNER JOIN Tenants ON TenantApartments.TenantID = Tenants.TenantID
GROUP BY TenantID
HAVING NumApartments > 1;
