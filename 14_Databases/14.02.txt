Open Requests:

Write a SQL query to get a list of all buildings and the number of open requests (Requests.Status = 'Open')

----

Requests table has AptID, which will be used in conjunction with the Apartments table to get the BuildingID and in turn with the Buildings table to get the BuildingName

If BuildingID is good enough...

SELECT BuildingID, COUNT(RequestID) as NumRequests
FROM requests
INNER JOIN Apartments ON Requests.AptID = Apartments.AptID
WHERE Status = 'Open'
GROUP BY BuildingID;

If we want to grab the BuildingName too...

SELECT BuildingName, ISNULL(NumRequests, 0) AS 'OpenRequestCount'
FROM buildings
LEFT JOIN
  (SELECT BuildingID, COUNT(RequestID) as NumRequests
  FROM requests
  INNER JOIN Apartments ON Requests.AptID = Apartments.AptID
  WHERE Status = 'Open'
  GROUP BY BuildingID) as CountSubQuery
ON Buildings.BuildingID = CountSubQuery.BuildingID;

The ISNULL call on line 19 allows us to have a count # of 0 for buildings without any open requests
Use Left Join for the same reason (INNER JOIN would throw away the buildings without any open requests)
