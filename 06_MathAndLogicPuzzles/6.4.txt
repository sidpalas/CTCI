Ants on a triangle:

Given n ants on an n-sided polygon, what is the likelihood
they will collide if they all chose a random direction (50/50 either
way) and walk at equal speeds?

Only way they don't collide is if they all choose the same direction

p_clock = (1/2)^n
p_cclock = (1/2)^n

p_noCollision = 2*(1/2)^n

p_collision = 1 - 2*(1/2)^n
