Dominos on a chessboard

8x8 chessboard with two diagonal corners removed:

  0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1 0

Both corners are the same color (either both white or both black)

When placing a domino, regardless of orientation it will always
cover one white square and one black square.

It is therefore impossible to cover a space with an unequal number
of white and black squares.  The chessboard will have 32 of one color
and 30 of the other (depending which corners are removed) so it
cannot be covered with the 31 dominos.
