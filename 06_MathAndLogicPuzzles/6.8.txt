Egg Drop:

First thought... drop at the midway point this would eliminate half of the floors immediately.
With unlimited eggs, the best approach would be to continue to divide in half, but with 2
eggs we can improve the worst case by starting lower

If it breaks, the worst case will equal the floor we started on b/c N could be that floor - 1 and
we would have to work our way up from the 1st by 1 to guarantee the 2nd egg doesnt break.

If it doesn't break we can move up by some amount... that amount should be one less than the starting
floor such that if it breaks at that point, we have enough drops remaining to not exceed the worst
case from above.

So we want the smallest m such that x + (x-1) + (x-2) + ... + (x - (m - 1)) > 100

This is true for m = 14 (14 + 13 + 12 + ... + 1) = 105.

So, start on the 14th floor.  If it breaks work up from 1.  If it remains intact, jump to 27th floor, then 39th floor, and so on.
