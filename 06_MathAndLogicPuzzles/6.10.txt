1000 Bottles and 1 is poisoned...

How to use 10 test strips (reusable if result is negative) to figure out which bottle is
poisoned as fast as possible.

One test per day and 7 days to receive result.

I didn't realize you could run an additional test in the interim and came up w/ solution
to solve in 3 tests maximum (28 days).

1) Split into 11 groups (10 x 90, 1 x 100)
2a) If one comes back positive that leaves 9 strips for 90 Bottles
    split into 10 x 9
2b) If none come back positive that leaves 10 strips for 100 Bottles
    split into 10 x 9, 1 x 10
3a) 9 x 1
3b) 9 x 1 (if one was positive), 10 x 1 if (none were positive)

The optimal solution was to map the use the binary representation of the bottle numbers
and put a drop on each set bit.

This will reveal the bottle precisely after just one test.

With 10 strips you can represent 2^10 (1024) bottles this way... too bad I didn't think of that.
