Blue Eyed Island

People with blue eyes must leave the island:
  - There is at least one person with blue eyes
  - They can see each others eyes but cant tell each other
  - One flight out per day

--------

1) If there is only one person w/ blue eyes, they see everyone else without them,
deduce that they must have blue eyes and leave on day 1 and its done.

2) If there are 2 people w/ blue eyes, they look around see only 1 other person
with blue eyes. If that person was indeed the only one they would have left on
day 1 (per above), so there must be 2.  They both realize this and leave on day 2.

3) The pattern continues, such that all n blue eyed people leave on the nth day by
using the deduction outlined above.
