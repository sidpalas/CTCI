We have the following method used in a chess game:

boolean canMoveTo(int x, int y)

The method is part of the Piece class and returns whether a piece can move to position (x,y).

How would you test this method?

------

Do we have access to the source? (white or black box testing?)

What are the allowable inputs (zero indexed...):
 x: [0, width of board]
 y: [0, height of board]

Normal inputs:
  for each Piece type:
    - Attempting to move to space on board that doesn't have another piece occupying it
    - Attempting to move to space on board that does have another piece occupying it
    - Moving in both positive and negative (according to index) directions
    - Trying each type of move (i.e. pawn can move diagonal, but only to take a piece)
    - Testing the nuances of blocking vs non-blocking pieces (horse can jump over, but other pieces cannot)

Edge cases:
  - Attempting to move to the location a piece already is located

Erroneous Inputs (should method return false or throw error?):
  - Attempting to move off the board
  - Inputing non-integer values

Other:
  - Many moves depend on the state of the board, we would want to test how the board data is passed to the method (or however that interaction is handled)
