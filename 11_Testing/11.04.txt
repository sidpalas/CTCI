How would you load test a webpage without using any testing tools?

Can we still use SW?

Yes:
Write a program that that performs a variety of different load sequences and ramp up (parallel) usage while recording load times and checking for error codes?

No:
Mechanical Turk? Have many people all simultaneously follow a manual testing procedure
