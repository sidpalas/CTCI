You are given the source (white box testing) to an application which crashes when it runs.

After running it 10 times in a debugger you find it never crashes in the same place. It is single threaded and only uses the C standard library.

What errors could be causing.

-----

Errors which appear to be random like this are oftentimes have to do with pointers being used incorrectly.

Internal:
The code depends on a pointer which was never set to the correct value and it depends on that block of memory happening to be equal to zeros
  - Find all uses of pointers and check whether they are initialized to the correct values
A memory overflow could cause the program to crash in different places because the timing would vary
  - how to debug?

External:
  - Dependencies could be causing the crash
