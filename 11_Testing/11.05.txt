How would you test a pen?

-----

1) Who is the user of the pen and what are the use cases?
2) What type of pen (refillable? click? cap?)
3) Could also observe representative users to understand how they will use the pen
4) Break it down into its various components:

  - Inner plastic with ink + tip:
    - writing under nominal conditions
    - writing at various angles
    - writing at various speeds
    - writing on different surfaces
    - testing how long in lasts with use
    - testing how long ink lasts without use (age test)

  - Outer shell:
    - durability
    - ergonomics

  - Cap:
    - does cap stay on under expected conditions (static, dynamic, amount/direction of force required to get it off)

  - Integrated (full pen):
    - refill process

  - Extreme:
    - Using the pen for nonstandard cases (opening a box, poking a hole in something, etc...)
