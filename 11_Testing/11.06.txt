How would you test an ATM in a distributed banking system?

-------

Who is using?
How many ATMS are there?
Where are they located?
Do they accept deposits or only withdrawls?
How much throughput?

Structure:

Location
-- test across each type of location (i.e. different countries/states/etc...)

Security:
-- examine how difficult it is to open under a variety of conditions
-- test camera recording operations
-- test data storage operations

Mechanical:
-- money delivery
-- restocking operations
-- test impact of environmental conditions

SW:
-- test network connectivity
-- test SW update

Nominal Operations:
-- test withdrawls requiring every type of bill
-- test min withdrawl
-- test withdrawl maximum
-- fraud detection systems?

Non-standard operations:
-- test > withdrawl maximum
-- test different card types (in-network, not in-network)
-- non-debit cards
-- rapid withdrawl/deposits
